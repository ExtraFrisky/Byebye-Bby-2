# Episode 2
Oh boy, here we go again. Coming soon™

Sneak peak:  
* Downtime, all the time. So much for 99.99% uptime SLA. ;) 
* No one wants to register, or host malicious domains. 
* Client dualhook? (shocker!)
* Skid devs having a hard time keeping public bots in their servers. ;) 
* Another website posting the work of Bby Bad Actors has been spotted! https://bbyexposed.github.io/  
* EXTRA JUICY: Exclusive chatlogs (Paid dualhook for all who pay? :O)

Sneak peak subject to legitimacy review. I won't post fake news on this.  
I'm not in it for a cheap lie, I want hard facts.  


  
Stay tuned.
